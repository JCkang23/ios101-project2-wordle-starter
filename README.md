# Project 2 - *Wordle*

Submitted by: **Josue Cikanga**

**Wordle** is an app that allows the player to guess predefined possible 5 character words, and reward them with different color combinations in each cell of the table, if the guess is completely, half, or not at all correct 

Time spent: **10** hours spent in total

## Required Features

## Notes

Initially, I was struggling with "settings"... I was thinking of it as a method instead of a dictionnary / hashmap
